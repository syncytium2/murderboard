# vendored from interface2 @ f0bdaab1 — do NOT edit here; update interface2 tools/session-start.hook.sh and re-copy
# Generic SessionStart briefing — runs at every session start / resume.
# Its stdout is injected into the session's context.
#
# CANONICAL SOURCE: interface2 tools/session-start.hook.sh (vendored elsewhere).
# It is self-configuring (derives the repo name and the sibling worktrees dir), so
# a consumer repo copies it to .claude/hooks/session-start.sh unchanged and wires it
# in .claude/settings.json (see docs/session_protocol.md). A repo may layer its own
# repo-specific checks around this core; keep the core intact so it stays re-copyable.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HARD CONSTRAINT — this hook BLOCKS session initialization until it exits, and the
# SDK aborts the whole session at 60s ("Subprocess initialization did not complete
# within 60000ms"; the message blames auth/network, which is a red herring). Exiting 0
# is therefore NOT sufficient: "never fails" is not "never blocks". A hook that always
# succeeds but returns too late takes the session down anyway.
#
# This cost us ~half a day in interface2 on 2026-07-30 at 32 worktrees. Full writeup:
# interface2 docs/postmortems/session-start-hook-timeout.md. Two rules came out of it:
#   * Bound the WHOLE script with a deadline, not each call. Per-call caps MULTIPLY
#     (32 worktrees x 3s = 96s, which is the bug again).
#   * Degrade LOUDLY. A section dropped for budget must say so, or a silent all-clear
#     masquerades as a real one.
# Wire a `"timeout"` into the settings.json hook entry as a second line of defence,
# set ABOVE this budget and below the SDK's 60s.
#
# Tune with env vars if a consumer repo needs to: IF2_HOOK_BUDGET (seconds),
# IF2_HOOK_DEADLINE (seconds; must match the settings.json "timeout" for this hook).
#
# SURVIVING A RUN THAT BLOWS THE DEADLINE. Bounding the work is the first defence; the
# second is making the failure legible, because a hook that is killed prints NOTHING and
# therefore cannot report its own death. Three per-repo files in $HOME carry that:
#   ~/.<repo>-hook-off       escape hatch: touch it and this briefing is skipped entirely.
#                            Needed because a hook slow enough to kill a session also
#                            blocks the session you would use to fix the hook.
#   ~/.<repo>-hook-running   latch, written on entry and removed on clean exit. Present at
#                            startup => the previous run died => SAFE MODE: print the
#                            diagnosis and exit, rather than repeating what just killed a
#                            session.
#   ~/.<repo>-hook-journal   per-section timings, truncated per run and NEVER deleted, so
#                            the profile survives whatever happened to the run.
# They are named per-repo deliberately: several repos vendor this hook and share $HOME, so
# one shared latch would let a sick hook in one repo put every other repo into SAFE MODE.
